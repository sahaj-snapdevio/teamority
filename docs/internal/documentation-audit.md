# Kanbanica -- Complete Documentation Audit

> **Superseded.** This was the earliest documentation audit (pre-dating the open-source conversion work). For current documentation status see the [`OPEN-SOURCE-RELEASE-REPORT.md`](./OPEN-SOURCE-RELEASE-REPORT.md) and the actionable items in [`RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`](./RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md). Kept for historical reference only.

**Roles applied:** Senior Product Manager, Staff Software Engineer, Solution Architect, Documentation Architect

**Audit Date:** 2026-06-09

## Overall Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Documentation Quality | 7.2 / 10 | Core feature docs (task, permission, auth, DB) are excellent. Supporting docs (services, keyboard, landing, customer support) were stubs or missing implementation detail. |
| Architecture Readiness | 7.8 / 10 | Permission model, async deletion, pg-boss pattern, and DB schema are well-designed. SSR safety for dnd-kit, FTS gap, and daily digest scheduling were unresolved. |
| Implementation Readiness | 6.5 / 10 | Phase 0 is safe to start. By Phase 5 (Tasks), devs will hit undocumented territory: upload pipelines, job payload specs, progress rollup queries, plan enforcement hooks. |
| Consistency Score | 7.5 / 10 | `improvement.md` corrects other docs without cross-links -- critical notes invisible to a developer reading only the feature doc. |

## Phase 2 -- krova-main Technical Patterns

| Technical Area | Pattern Found | Reusable for Kanbanica |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| pg-boss job registry | `JOB_NAMES` const + typed payloads + `QUEUE_OPTIONS` compile-time guard in `lib/worker/job-types.ts` | Yes -- adopt immediately for all 5 jobs |
| Two-process architecture | `next dev` + `tsx --watch scripts/worker.ts` via `concurrently` | Yes -- copy `package.json` scripts pattern |
| Idempotent job handlers | Each handler checks DB state before side effects; status machine claims before acting | Yes -- apply to workspace-delete, sprint-auto-close |
| `enqueueJob` singleton | Mutex-guarded PgBoss lazy init in `lib/worker/enqueue.ts`; `singletonKey` for deduplication | Yes -- copy pattern exactly |
| Audit fire-and-forget | `audit()` + `auditBatch()` in `lib/audit.ts`; errors logged, never thrown; `extractRequestContext()` for IP/UA | Yes -- use for `ActivityLog` writes |
| Env validation | `lib/env.ts` Zod schema at startup; typed `env` export everywhere; fail fast with clear errors | Yes -- implement in Phase 0 |
| Auth pattern in server actions | `auth.api.getSession()` at top; `requireActionMembershipAndPermission()`; early return `{ error: string }` | Yes -- standard for all server actions |
| Auth pattern in API routes | `lib/api/auth-helpers.ts` route-level helper; session -> 401, permission -> 403 | Yes -- all `/api/` routes |
| Storage delete ordering | R2 delete enqueued BEFORE DB delete; failed enqueue aborts deletion | Yes -- matches Kanbanica rule; shows exact code pattern |
| Pre-flight checks before side effects | All permission/precondition checks run before any write or enqueue | Yes -- adopt as a rule |
| `<LocalDate />` component | All timestamps rendered through it; prevents SSR/client hydration mismatch on date fields | Yes -- critical; build before any timestamp display |
| Error wrapper in actions | `try/catch`; inner `console.error`; outer always `{ error: "Something went wrong" }` | Yes -- all server actions |
| Lifecycle vs audit log separation | Operational logs vs security audit logs are separate tables; same fire-and-forget pattern | Yes -- `ActivityLog` vs `PlatformAuditLog` |
| Transaction + enqueue pattern | Jobs enqueued inside or immediately after DB transactions; payload consistent with DB state | Yes -- workspace deletion, sprint close |

---

## Phase 3 -- Documentation vs Technical Reference Gap Analysis

| Feature | Current Documentation Gap | Technical Improvement Suggested | Reason |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| Authentication | No env var validation spec; SMTP vars not listed; no startup failure behavior documented | Add: `lib/env.ts` block listing BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, SMTP_FROM; show Zod schema snippet | krova-main validates all env vars at startup; missing SMTP var causes runtime failure not startup failure |
| Workspace | Async deletion describes 202 response but not the pg-boss job payload shape, retry policy, or idempotency guard | Add: `WorkspaceDeletePayload` type; retry limit; idempotency guard (check `workspace.status` before proceeding); lifecycle log entries | krova-main's deletion job pattern is directly applicable |
| Space | No technical detail on how Public -> Private toggle is enforced at the query layer | Add: Private Spaces filter by `SpaceMember` existence at query layer; add `@@index([spaceId, userId])` on SpaceMember | Without this, a developer may implement the toggle incorrectly |
| List | No spec for `order_index` reordering strategy; no spec for duplicate-list deep copy operation | Add: `order_index` uses fractional indexing or integer gaps; duplicate-list is a DB transaction copying List -> ListStatus -> Task rows in order | krova-main's transaction pattern shows how to structure multi-step copy operations |
| Task | FTS gap acknowledged in `improvement.md` but not in `task.md` itself | Add: `description_text` generated column note (post-MVP Phase 11); until then, FTS on tasks is title-only | Critical architectural decision currently siloed in improvement.md |
| Task | Dependency DFS cycle detection: algorithm mentioned but no implementation path | Add: on `POST /api/tasks/:id/dependencies`, traverse graph from `dependsOnTaskId` upward using recursive CTE or in-memory DFS; return 400 on cycle | Without this, a developer may implement a naive check that misses multi-hop cycles |
| Subtask | Progress rollup formula documented but no Drizzle ORM query pattern; no N+1 warning | Add: computed on-the-fly with COUNT query; add `@@index([parentTaskId])`; no caching needed at MVP scale | Without this, a developer may write an N+1 query per task card in list view |
| Sprint | Auto-close trigger mentioned as pg-boss cron but no job name, schedule, or payload spec | Add: `JOB_NAMES.SPRINT_AUTO_CLOSE`; cron schedule (every 15 min); `SprintAutoClosePayload` with `sprintId`; idempotency guard | krova-main's billing-hourly cron handler pattern is directly applicable |
| Sprint | Incomplete task strategy (move_to_backlog / move_to_next_sprint / leave_as_is) documented as UX only | Add: transaction spec -- `move_to_backlog` deletes TaskSprint rows; `move_to_next_sprint` creates new Sprint and inserts TaskSprint rows; all in one transaction | Multi-step operations need transactional guards |
| Views | dnd-kit Board View: no note on Next.js 15 App Router SSR incompatibility | Add: wrap all dnd-kit components in `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })`; dnd-kit accesses `window` on import and will crash SSR | improvement.md calls this out; views.md is where the note belongs |
| Views | `UserListViewPreference` deferred to Phase 12 but views.md does not mention this | Add: these tables are deferred to Phase 12; until then default to List View and use localStorage for transient preference | database-schema.md is correct; views.md is silent |
| Collaboration | File attachment upload pipeline: doc says files go to S3/R2 but no presigned URL flow spec | Add: client requests presigned PUT URL; client uploads directly to R2; client calls confirm endpoint; server validates and creates DB record | krova-main's storage pattern shows the exact ordering rule |
| Notifications | Daily digest pg-boss job: mentioned in UserEmailPreference but no job name, schedule, or handler spec | Add: `JOB_NAMES.NOTIFICATION_DIGEST`; 30-min cron that fans out per-user jobs based on `digestTime` preference; `NotificationDigestPayload` with `userId` | Per-user delivery times require a batch cron, not a single daily cron |
| Notifications | VAPID keys must be generated; no env var spec given | Add: `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT`; generation command: `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys` | krova-main's env.ts pattern shows exactly how to validate at startup |
| Search & Filters | search.md implies full task search works; FTS on jsonb is not documented as limited | Add: task description search is post-MVP (Phase 11+); global search queries `title` and `name` fields only | Developer reading search.md without reading improvement.md will implement broken search |
| Permission Model | `canPerformAction()` pseudo-code has no codebase location note; no middleware vs route handler boundary | Add: lives in `src/lib/permissions.ts`; Next.js middleware only checks authentication (session presence), not authorization | Kanbanica needs a clear authn/authz boundary |
| Admin Panel | Impersonation 1-hour auto-expire mentioned but no implementation detail | Add: pg-boss cron (`impersonation.cleanup`) runs every 5 min and revokes sessions where `impersonatedBy IS NOT NULL AND createdAt < NOW() - 1 hour` | Security-critical feature; implementation path must be explicit |
| Customer Support | Missing user flows, notification triggers, auto-close job, admin UI screens | Add full user flow, notification table, pg-boss auto-close spec, admin vs user permission separation | Was a data model stub; cannot be built from original doc |

## Top 10 Reusable Engineering Patterns from krova-main

1. **`job-types.ts` registry** -- `JOB_NAMES` const + typed payload per job + `QUEUE_OPTIONS` compile-time guard. Apply to all 5 Kanbanica background jobs immediately. This pattern prevents ad-hoc job management and catches missing queue definitions at compile time.

2. **`lib/audit.ts` fire-and-forget** -- `audit()` function wraps DB insert in `try/catch`; errors are logged but never thrown; includes `extractRequestContext()` for IP/UA from Next.js headers. Apply identically to Kanbanica's `ActivityLog` writes.

3. **`lib/env.ts` Zod validation** -- All env vars validated at startup with Zod schema; typed `env` export used everywhere instead of `process.env`. Implement in Phase 0 before writing any feature code. Fail fast on missing vars with descriptive messages.

4. **Server action auth pattern** -- `auth.api.getSession()` at the top of every server action; `requireActionMembershipAndPermission()` for permission checks; early return `{ error: string }` throughout. Never inline session checks inside business logic.

5. **Enqueue-before-delete storage ordering** -- Storage cleanup jobs enqueued BEFORE the DB transaction commits; failed enqueue aborts deletion and returns error. Applies to all Kanbanica attachment and avatar deletes.

6. **Pre-flight checks before side effects** -- All precondition checks (permission, resource existence, business rules) run before any DB write or job enqueue. Prevents partial state on validation failure.

7. **Lifecycle vs audit log separation** -- Operational context in lifecycle logs (free-form, entity-scoped); security records in audit logs (structured, actor-scoped). Maps directly to Kanbanica's `ActivityLog` vs `PlatformAuditLog`.

8. **Transaction + enqueue pattern** -- Jobs enqueued inside or immediately after DB transactions. Ensures job payload is consistent with DB state at enqueue time. Apply to workspace deletion and sprint auto-close.

9. **`concurrently` two-process dev** -- `next dev` + `tsx --watch scripts/worker.ts` run simultaneously via `concurrently`. Copy the `package.json` scripts pattern exactly. Start this in Phase 0 even with zero handlers registered.

10. **Server action error wrapper** -- Every action wrapped in `try/catch`; inner error logged with `console.error("actionName error:", error)`; outer catch always returns `{ error: "Something went wrong..." }`. Never leaks stack traces to the client.

---

## Top 10 Architecture Improvements

1. **Add `src/lib/env.ts` in Phase 0** -- Validate DATABASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, SMTP_*, R2_*, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL at startup. Fail fast with clear messages. Never access `process.env` directly outside this file.

2. **Add `src/lib/worker/job-types.ts` in Phase 0** -- Even with zero jobs implemented, the registry and enqueue infrastructure should exist before any async operation is written. Prevents ad-hoc job management discovered late.

3. **Add `<LocalDate />` before any timestamp display** -- Without it, React SSR/client hydration mismatches will produce errors on all date fields. Must exist before task detail panel is built (Phase 5).

4. **Add `src/lib/permissions.ts` as standalone module** -- Implement `canPerformAction(userId, workspaceId, spaceId, action)` as a pure function callable from API routes, server actions, and tests. Never inline permission logic in route handlers.

5. **Plan `description_text` generated column for Phase 11** -- PostgreSQL `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` column extracting text from Tiptap jsonb is required for FTS. Plan the migration now; do not defer the decision until Phase 11 discovery.

6. **Redesign notification digest job architecture** -- Per-user `digestTime` in `UserEmailPreference` requires a 30-minute batch cron that fans out per-user jobs -- not a single daily cron. This is more complex than it appears; spec it before Phase 14.

7. **Adopt fractional indexing for `order_index` fields** -- Integer gaps (1000, 2000, 3000) require periodic rebalancing when exhausted. Consider string-based fractional keys or the `fractional-indexing` library for drag-and-drop ordering on Tasks, Lists, and Sprints.

8. **Define `src/lib/plan.ts` enforcement layer in Phase 17** -- `checkPlanLimit(workspaceId, limitKey)` must be called from API routes (not just frontend). Define its interface and error response format before the Plans phase begins.

9. **Add `(marketing)` route group in Phase 0** -- The public landing page must be isolated from the authenticated app layout from the start. Retrofitting later requires moving files and fixing layout hierarchies.

10. **Start `scripts/worker.ts` as concurrent process from Phase 0** -- Even with no handlers registered, the worker process should run in dev from day one. Discovering `concurrently` integration issues in Phase 8 (workspace deletion) is costly.

---

## Top 10 Missing Technical Notes

1. **Task description FTS requires `description_text` generated column** -- jsonb full-text search in PostgreSQL requires a `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` column extracting text from the Tiptap jsonb. Standard `@@to_tsquery` against a jsonb column does not work. This affects the entire search feature scope.

2. **dnd-kit crashes SSR in Next.js App Router** -- Any component importing dnd-kit will fail server-side render. All Board View and Calendar View components must be wrapped in `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })`. Not wrapping causes a hard crash in production builds.

3. **Email deliverability requires SPF/DKIM/DMARC before launch** -- Magic link emails will land in spam without DNS record configuration. Setup takes 24-48 hours for DNS propagation; this cannot be done on launch day.

4. **pg-boss worker must be a separate long-running process** -- pg-boss does not run inside Next.js API routes or server actions. A dedicated `scripts/worker.ts` process must run alongside Next.js. This directly affects hosting choice (Vercel alone is insufficient).

5. **Daily digest job requires per-user scheduling** -- `UserEmailPreference.digestTime` is per-user. A single daily cron cannot honor arbitrary per-user delivery times. Requires a 30-minute batch cron that queries users whose digest window has just arrived and fans out per-user jobs.

6. **`taskSeq` increment must be atomic inside a DB transaction** -- Use `UPDATE workspace SET task_seq = task_seq + 1 WHERE id = ? RETURNING task_seq` with a row lock inside the task creation transaction. Prevents sequence gaps or duplicate task numbers under concurrent writes.

7. **Private Space visibility returns 404, not 403** -- Server-side queries must exclude spaces where the user is not a `SpaceMember`. The permission layer returns 404 to avoid leaking space existence. A 403 would confirm the space exists.

8. **Comment soft-delete requires parent check inside a transaction** -- A comment with no replies can be hard-deleted. A comment with replies must be soft-deleted (preserves thread structure). This check must be inside a transaction to prevent race conditions.

9. **`TaskDescriptionSnapshot` has a unique constraint on `taskId`** -- Only one snapshot per task. Saving a new description snapshot must use Drizzle ORM `upsert`, not `create`. A second `create` call will fail with a unique constraint violation.

10. **VAPID push subscriptions are invalidated when keys rotate** -- If VAPID keys are changed, all stored `PushSubscription` records become invalid. WebPush returns HTTP 410 Gone on stale subscriptions. The handler must delete the `PushSubscription` record on 410 to prevent repeated failed sends.

---

## "If Development Starts Tomorrow" -- Priority Order

### Day 1 -- Phase 0 Foundations (must complete before writing any feature code)

1. Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui
2. Create `src/lib/env.ts` -- Zod validation of all env vars; fail fast on startup with clear messages
3. Set up PostgreSQL locally (Docker), run `npx drizzle-kit generate && npx drizzle-kit migrate`
4. Configure `scripts/worker.ts` + `concurrently` in `package.json`; start the worker even with zero handlers
5. Create `src/lib/worker/job-types.ts` with empty `JOB_NAMES` and `QUEUE_OPTIONS`
6. Create `src/lib/db.ts` (Drizzle ORM singleton) and `src/lib/auth.ts` (Better Auth instance)
7. Set up Biome for linting/formatting
8. Create `(marketing)` and `(app)` route groups; stub layouts with correct auth/no-auth separation
9. Add `<LocalDate />` to `src/components/ui/local-date.tsx`
10. Create `.env.example` with all required/optional var names (no values)

### Week 1 -- Core Auth and Workspace (Phases 1-2)

11. Implement magic link auth with Better Auth; test end-to-end email delivery
12. Implement workspace creation, invite, and role assignment
13. Implement async workspace deletion (202 + pg-boss job + idempotency guard)

## Overview

Kanbanica is a self-hostable, ClickUp-style project management app. Teams organize their work in **Workspaces → Projects → Lists / Sprints → Tasks**, with real-time collaboration, notifications, and a fast, keyboard-friendly UI. It's a complete, production-grade codebase you can clone, run, extend, and deploy on your own infrastructure.

## Features

- 🗂️ **Workspaces, Projects, Lists & Sprints** — a flexible hierarchy for organizing any team's work
- ✅ **Rich tasks** — assignees, due dates, priorities, subtasks/checklists, attachments, and Tiptap-powered descriptions
- 🏃 **Sprints** — sprint planning, story points, and automatic sprint close
- 📌 **Multiple views** — Board, List, Calendar, and a cross-workspace "My Tasks"
- 💬 **Collaboration** — comments, @mentions, reactions, and an activity feed
- ⚡ **Real-time sync** — live updates over SSE as teammates make changes
- 🔔 **Notifications** — in-app, email digests, and Web Push
- 🔐 **Two-level permissions** — workspace roles + per-project permissions, with guests
- 🔑 **Passwordless auth** — magic-link login (or Google OAuth)
- 🎨 **Themeable UI** — light/dark, built on shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4
- 🛠️ **Admin panel** — user, queue, and email visibility

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM |
| Auth | Better Auth (magic link / Google OAuth) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui |
| Rich Text | Tiptap |
| State | Zustand (client) + SWR (server) |
| Real-time | Server-Sent Events (SSE) |
| Background Jobs | pg-boss worker |
| Email | Nodemailer (SMTP) |
| File Storage | files-sdk (local FS in dev → S3/R2 in prod) |

## Quick Start

Requires **Node.js 22** and **pnpm**. No separate database install needed — a local Postgres is bundled for development.

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL> kanbanica
cd kanbanica
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm db:local     # start the bundled dev database (leave running)
pnpm db:migrate   # create the tables (first time only)
pnpm dev          # start the web app + worker
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>, sign in with a magic link (the link is printed in the terminal when SMTP isn't configured), then make yourself an admin:

```bash
pnpm make:admin you@example.com
```

📖 Full step-by-step walkthrough (with troubleshooting): **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)**.

## Local Development

- `pnpm dev` runs the Next.js app **and** the pg-boss worker together.
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm typecheck` — code quality checks.
- Architecture, conventions, and per-feature specs live in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) and the [`docs/`](./docs) folder.

See **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** for the complete local-development guide.

## Self-Hosting

Deploy Kanbanica for your team with Docker Compose (Postgres + app + worker, one command). See the full production guide: **[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # configure DATABASE_URL, APP_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL + an auth provider
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Email:** magic-link login works with **any SMTP provider** (Resend recommended, or Brevo/Postmark/SES/…) — configure it via env vars; see [DEPLOYMENT.md → Production email](./DEPLOYMENT.md#production-email-smtp). Each deployment uses its own credentials; nothing is committed.
